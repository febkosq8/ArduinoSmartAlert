## Installation Steps

- Using the component mentioned above, recreate the circuit shown above
- Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and install on your system
- Proceed to download the [ArduinoSmartAlert.ino](/ArduinoSmartAlert.ino) from this repo into your system
- After that, connect your Arduino Uno to your PC
- Open the [ArduinoSmartAlert.ino](/ArduinoSmartAlert.ino) file/sketch
- If your installation was succcessful, the Arduino Sketch will be loaded into the IDE and your Ardunio Uno should have been auto detected now by the IDE
- Upload the sketch into your Arduino Uno
- Restart the Arduino Uno
- Your Arduino Uno should start automatically detecting the distance and trigger the alert system
> Note: While the cable is connected to your PC, you can use the Arduino IDE Serial Port to get real time updates on the obstacle distance. (Serial Port : 19200)
